SpektrumTm1000
==============

Decode and plot Spektrum TM1000 flight log files.  If you don't have an RC Heli or Fixed wing craft then you can 
probably ignore this.

Spektrum logs data from the TM1000 on the craft to an SD card in the TX.  The code here can decode these logs and 
produce basic charts.
